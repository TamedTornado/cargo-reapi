# Changelog

All notable changes to `cargo-reapi` are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-30

- Provision locked Cargo sources before entering strict offline snapshots, while
  keeping build scripts, proc macros, and compiler actions network-denied.
- Relocate all known-root paths in the compiler environment, including dynamic
  `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*`, config-relative, and build-script-emitted values.
- Fail fast with an actionable diagnostic when an inherited
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` would make cargo-reapi manage the target containing its
  own running executable, while preserving intentional external targets.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

Initial public release.

- Keeps Cargo authoritative by observing the compiler and linker actions Cargo
  schedules through `RUSTC_WRAPPER`.
- Adds verified cross-worktree action caching and exact whole-gate snapshots,
  including concurrent miss coalescing and content-addressed output storage.
- Keys declared inputs, toolchain identity, platform, arguments, working
  directory, relevant environment, native link inputs, and outputs.
- Restores artifacts into independent worktrees with fixed-width path
  relocation, digest verification, and macOS executable re-signing.
- Adds host-wide CPU and memory admission for physical work, cache inspection
  and garbage collection, environment diagnostics, and proof tooling.
- Adds a reclient transport adapter for eligible Remote Execution API actions.
  Validation against a live production REAPI service remains future work.
- Qualifies the local shared-cache path independently on macOS/arm64 APFS and
  Linux/x86_64 XFS with real Cargo, Bevy, and Moria workloads.

Known limitations and the precise qualified boundary are documented in the
[README](README.md#known-limitations-and-roadmap).
